Atoms and subatomic particles

In the previous lesson Chemistry was defined as science which studies matter 
- its composition, properties, and interactions with other matter as well as with energy.
Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. 
Since Chemistry studies matter,
a clear understanding of the composition of matter is therefore necessary. 
Dalton's atomic theory does not only reveal
the composition of matter, it also explains what happen when matter undergoes chemical changes.
Dalton's atomic theory relates the events of chemical change to the properties, structure and behavior of atoms.

For chemical change - a change during which new substance is formed - to occur, matter must interact with other matter 
or with energy. For instance, Sodium metal, a matter, can interact with water another matter to produce Sodium hydroxide
Cooking gas, propane can interact with heat, an energy to produce carbon dioxide and water. Hydrogen can react with 
oxygen to produce water. Matter can also undergo a change without producing a new substance. This is called a physical
change.  For instance, water can change state from solid(ice) to liquid and then to gas. In this case, no new substance
is formed.

Dalton's Atomic theory
1. Matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
2. Atoms are indivisible and indestructible.
3. Atoms of a particular element are identical.
4. Atoms of different elements are different.
5. Compounds are formed when different atoms combine with one another, and for any particular compound, no matter the source,
its constituent atoms constant and  will always occur in constant ratio.
6. During the formation of compounds atoms are neither created nor destroyed but simply re-arrange themselves. 

Modification of Dalton's Atomic Theory.
The findings of other researchers after John Dalton, especially those of J.J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford
 have shown that Dalton's Atomic Theory is not completely correct. Dalton understood what matter contains and what happens
 when matter interacts with one another but did not completely understand what the atoms themselves contain.
 It is still true that matter is composed of atoms. It true that during most non-nuclear reactions atoms are neither 
 created nor destroyed but merely re-arrange themselves to form new compounds. It is still true that different atoms
 exist. It it true that atoms of the same element are similar in many ways, for instance they are have the same number of 
 protons , and therefore the same atomic number  but it is not true that atoms of the same element are identical. 
 Atoms of the same elements can show variation 
 in their number of neutrons -  a phenomenon called isotopy. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with the same
 number of protons but different number of neutrons. For example, all Carbon atoms have six protons in their nucleus,
 but majority of the carbon atoms have 6 neutrons in their nucleus - Carbon-12, while some of the carbon atoms have 8 
 neutrons - Carbon-14  in their nucleus.

 It is not also true that atoms are indivisible. Dalton'S model of atom as a solid mass is not correct. 
 The divisibility of matter can go beyond the atom to subatomic particles. Atoms is made of of mostly empty space 
 with a central nucleus which contains the positively charged protons and the non-charged neutrons with peripherally
 located negative  electrons.  


 Subatomic Particles
 Show table of the sub atomic particles
 The type of subatomic particle, their location in the atom, as well as their charges and mass is shown in the 
 table above.
  protons
  protons are located in the nucleus of the atom. It has a mass of about 1.67 * 10-24 grams. 
  This mass is equal to one atomic mass unit(amu). It is also equal to the mass of one neutron. One atomic mass unit is also equal to the  1/12 the mass of one 
  atom of carbon-12. This atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Protons contribute significantly to the mass of the atom
  Protons have a charge of +1. All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus which will 
  different from the number of protons in the atoms of another element. For example, all atoms of hydrogen have 
  one proton in their nucleus, all atoms of Helium has two protons in their nucleus, no other element other than Helium
  will have atoms with two protons in their nucleus and no other element other than hydrogen will have atoms with 1 proton
  in their nucleus. You get the idea, hopefully. therefore elements derive their identity from the atomic number.
  will have aton 
 
  number is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom.
