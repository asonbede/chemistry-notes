Electronic Configuration
Electrons in the Bohr's Atomic Model can only be found at specific energy levels and not in-between.
The main energy levels  are made up of sub-energy levels which are themselves composed of orbitals.
The electronic Configuration is a description of of an atoms  main energy levels, the sub-energy
levels, the  orbitals and the 
number of electrons those orbitals can contain. The number and letter respectively
 describe the energy levels and sub-levels while the superscript shows how many electrons are in that 
 orbital.
 The electronic Configuration of sodium for instance is 1s22s22p63s1.
 Look at the sodium electronic Configuration again. You will see numbers, letters and then
 numbers written in superscript. What the heck does those numbers and letters mean?
  The numbers(not the ones in superscript) represent the principal quantum numbers(n) or the 
  main energy levels. Electrons begin to occupy energy level starting from the ones with the 
  lest energy, that is, the energy level closest to the nucleus. This energy level with the 
  lest energy is also called the ground state. Each energy level has the maximum number of 
  electrons it can hold. Using the formula 2n2, you  can calculate this maximum. When n = 1,
  the maximum is 2 electrons, When n = 2, the maximum = 8 electrons, When n= 3 what will be
  the maximum? 18 of course. The value of  the principal quantum number can be any integer 
  that is greater than or equal to one. Sodium has atomic number of 11, it therefore has 11 
  protons in its nucleus and 11 electrons outside the nucleus in its neutral state.
   Two of this electrons will move
  into the first energy. This is the maximum that n=1 can accommodate, eight electrons will then 
  occupy n= 2, this is the maximum for n=2, so the remaining one electron of sodium will move 
  into n= 3 which has the capacity to accommodate 18 electrons but
   unfortunately sodium has ran out
  of electrons. Each  energy level does not only have the maximum number of electrons 
  it can contain, it is also divisible into sub-energy levels. Think of the energy levels 
  as a building and the sub-energy levels as the rooms inside the building.
   The possible sub energy level associated with each energy level is given by 
   the relation 0 to n-1, 
  when = 1  , this relation evaluates to 0, only one sub-shell is possible, when n= 2 , 
  the relation evaluates
  to 0,1 , two sub-shells are possible, when n=3, 0,1,2 three sub shell are possible. 
  Those numbers
  describing the sub-shells are called the Azimuthal quantum number or the angular
  momentum quantum number(l). l=0 is known as the "S" sub shell, l=1 is the p subshell,
   l= 2 is the 
  d subshell l=3 f subshell. The subshells S, p, d, f are also divisible into compartments
  called orbitals. Given a subshell, the number of orbitals possible is given by the relation 
  -l to +l , where l is equal to the Azimuthal quantum number. When l = 0, only one orbital is
  possible. When l=1 ,  3 orbitals are possible -1,0, +1, when l is 2,  5 orbitals are 
  possible -2, -1, 0, 1,2 , and when l=3 how many orbitals are possible? You have already 
  thought of the main shell as a building and the subshells  as the room or rooms insides the 
  the building now think of the orbitals as compartments inside a room.
   Each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons.
  Therefore, the S subshell with one possible orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.
  The P subshell with a three possible orbitals can hold a maximum of six electrons. The 
  d subshell with 5 orbitals can hold ten electrons. Those numbers that we derived from the Azimuthal 
  quantum number which tell us number of orbitals within a subshell is called Magnetic quantum
  number(mi).
  Now back to the electronic configuration of sodium: 1s22s22p63s1.
  The eleven electrons will begin by occupying n= 1, because it is the easiest to occupy
  since it has the lest energy. n= 1 , has one subshell l=0 which is the S subshell, l=0 has only
  one orbital ml= 0 , and each orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons. The number 
  in superscript is telling us the number of electrons in that subshell. So 1s2 is the sodium 
  electron configuration is a shorthand way of saying that the first energy level with its
  its one subshell and one orbital has been occupied by two electrons. Similarly,
  2s22p6 is a shorthand way of saying that the second energy level with its its two subshell 
  has been occupied by eight electrons. Remember n=2 can have l values of 0, l and l= 1 can have 
  mi values of -1,0,+1 and hence 3 orbitals each of which can hold a maximum of 2 electrons
   giving
  maximum  of 6 electrons for the p subshell. The remaining one electron of sodium
  will enter n= 3 which can actually have 3 sub-shell s, p, d, 
  and accommodate a maximum of 18 Electrons
  2 in the s, 6 in p and 10 in d.      Since the "s" subshell is the 
  lest in energy among those n=3 sub-shells, the electron will enter there and that is how 
  we arrived at 3s1 in sodium electron configuration.
  
  The table that summarizes

  Electron Configuration of the first 30 elements in the periodic table
  1H: 1s1
  2H: 1s2
  3Li: 1s22s1 
  4Be: 1s22s2

  7N : 1s22s22p3
  8O : 1s22s22p4
  9F : 1s22s22p5

  13Al:1s22s22p63s23p1
  14Si: 1s22s22p63s23p2
  15P: 1s22s22p63s23p3
  16S:   1s22s22p63s23p4
  17Cl: 1s22s22p63s23p5
  18A:  1s22s22p63s23p6
  19K:  1s22s22p63s23p64s1
  20Ca: 1s22s22p63s23p64s2
  21Sc:  1s22s22p63s23p64s23d1
  22Ti:  1s22s22p63s23p64s23d2


Wait a minute. The way we filled 19K, 20Ca, 21Sc, 22Ti does it make sense? Is it logical? n= 3 
can have 3 sub-shells s, p, d. We have only filled 3s and 3p why didn't we fill 3d before going 
to 4s, after all we had filled out all the possible sub-shells sub-shells for n=2 before going to n= 3.
It is not logical of course. However, in science observations and experiments are superior to 
logic. Observations had shown that the 4s subshell or orbital is of lower energy than the 3d orbitals
or subshell. Energy levels or subshell with lower energy are filled first before those with 
higher energy. So the 4s is filled before the 3d. So the electrons don't necessarily fill the sub-shells
in ascending order of n values. Now let us talk about the order in which the electrons fills the
sub-shells.

The order in which the electrons fill the sub-shells
is as follows:

1s,2s,2p,3s,3p,4s,3d,4p,5s,4d,5p,6s,4f,5d,6p,7s,5f,6d,7p...
 This order arranges the energy level and sub energy levels in ascending order of energy.
 You may memories it but if you are familiar with the periodic table you need not memories it.
 This order is already in agreement with natural placement of the elements in the periodic table.
 Take a Look at the periodic table below: 

 The periodic table is divided into blocks. The first two columns make up the s-block.
 This column contain elements whose outermost shell electrons are in the s subshell,
 The last six columns make up the p-block, the ten columns of elements between the s-block 
 and p-block make up d-block. They have their outermost electrons in the 
 d-subshell , then the bottom fourteen columns make up the f-block.
 Now if you move across the rows beginning from the top left of the table and then 
 move across successive rows, you will arrive at the same order of filling orbitals
 as i listed above.  You  will also see how many electrons fit into each orbital. The animation 
 should make this even clearer.
 With that clarification out of the way
 Let's continue with writing the electronic configuration for the rest of the
 elements.

  Wait a minute again, did you notice how long some of the electron configuration
  had become? It is becoming inconvenient to write or read them, 
  especially when n value is relatively large? For instance uranium is
  ---------
  The solution to long things is to appreciate them. We have done it before. For instance
  1 amu, the mass of one proton or one neutron  is about 1.67 *10-24, this is an extremely 
  number, imagine writing all those zeros one by one. The mass of the electron is even 
  smaller, so we appreciated them using the scientific notion. Enough of the ranting, how do 
  we abbreviate electron configuration?

  Abbreviating Electron Configuration
  step 1 identify the noble gas nearest to the element whose electron configuration
  you want to write.
  step 2 put the atomic symbol of the noble in square brackets.
  step 3 write the electron configuration of the element with the electron configuration
  of that noble gas excluded

  Examples:
  write the appreciated electron configuration of 19K,
  The nearest nobel gas to potassium is argon.
  The electron configuration of argon and that of potassium are respectively
18A:  1s22s22p63s23p6
 19K: 1s22s22p63s23p64s1
 notice that they are very similar.  think of the electron configuration of K as a superset
 of that of argon
 This similarity hold for other elements as well.
 The electron configuration of any element will be similar to the electron configuration of 
 its nearest noble gas.
 Now if we do this [ 1s22s22p63s23p6]4s1, we have written K's electron configuration but then
 this is no longer an appreciation. Instead we put just the symbol of argon inside
 the brackets. You get the idea.
 So the abbreviated electron configuration of K IS [A]4s1
 
 Okay let us write electron configuration of other elements using this abbreviated form.
